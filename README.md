# branch_and_bound
This repository implements a basic Branch and Bound (B&amp;B) algorithm to solve simple Integer Programming (IP) problems. The approach relaxes the original IP into a Linear Programming (LP) problem, then dynamically generates branching constraints on decision variables during the search.
